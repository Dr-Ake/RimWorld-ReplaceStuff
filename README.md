# Replace Stuff

Replace Stuff is a RimWorld mod that lets you change the material of an existing building without tearing it down. Walls, workbenches and other structures can be upgraded in-place.

## Features

- Swap materials without deconstructing or losing bills.
- Rooms stay intact so temperature is preserved.
- Blueprints can be placed over rock and fog.
- Buildings ordered over existing copies are automatically replaced.

## Building

Open `Replace Stuff.sln` in Visual Studio and build the **Release** configuration. This uses the metadata from `About/About-Release.xml` to create the release version of the mod.

A working release is also available on the repository's releases page.
